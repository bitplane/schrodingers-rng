Schr√∂dinger's RNG
=================

Pulls random numbers from a video source attached to a smoke alarm hardware 
number generator. To make one just take a cheap, Linux-compatible webcam, 
remove the lens and glue the radiation source from a smoke alarm to the sensor,
give it a tinfoil hat, tape it up and plug it in. Yeah and don't ever burn it.

Until you observe me working on this project, it is both dead and alive.

Instructions
------------

Run ./configure.sh to create the named pipe and gather stats
